      <p>This summer, I received a RISD Textron Grant to work with Dr. Lynn Rothschild at NASA Ames 
        Research Center as an Astrobiology intern. Her lab exists at a unique intersection of biology 
        and space innovation--both in the context of examining origin of life on and potentially off-earth, 
        as well as utilizing biology as technology for use in aerospace. I worked within a sub-team within 
        her lab, which was centered upon exploring paper microfluidics for use in space. There were a lot 
        of talented scientists within her lab interested in building in situ biosensors, as well as others 
        investigating origin of life and biomarkers for life off-earth.
        <br><br><br>
        <b>I was asked to dream big -- to imagine what kind of tools might advance this pursuit -- and to envision 
        what a system of biosensing off-earth might look like.</b>
        <br><br> <br>
       Prior to the summer, I had taken a Design for Space Systems class with Professor Rick Fleeter at Brown; 
       from this course, I had a sense of how the priorities for space were different from earth. 
       In space, payload volume, mass, and risk are all factors that have to be considered heavily--
       each mission to space involves a large investment in time and resources; thus, any payload that 
       is incorporated into the mission must optimize these factors.

         for, I constructed this initial problem statement:</p>

      <p>My research this summer involved first examining the existing solutions to remote sensing, consulting with 
        experts in the fields of microfluidics, space systems design, as well as planetary science. It also involved 
        researching relevant advances in remote sensing and biotechnology:</p>

        I ended up designing two seed pod-inspired platforms for a novel system of swarm-based remote sensing, one for earth-based applications,
         and the other for off-earth environments.

       At the end of the summer, Dr. Rothschild and I submitted the project to the NASA Ames Innovation Fair. Using Adobe After Effects 
       and Premiere Pro, I animated a proposal video, which describes the project design and research in more detail:</p>
